"""Tinker compatibility: serve Tinker's HTTP protocol over Arctic backends.

:mod:`~cortex_training.tinker.router` is the protocol adapter and
knows nothing about a backend; :mod:`~cortex_training.tinker.cortex`
binds its verbs to Cortex Training through the unified client. Nothing is
imported here -- the router pulls in FastAPI, which a caller who only wants the
adapter helpers should not pay for.
